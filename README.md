# API_image-search-abstraction-layer

This is a FCC Image search Abstraction tutorial

There are two routes which use can use.

`https://mighty-mesa-11110.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/:` follow by your query

`https://mighty-mesa-11110.herokuapp.com/api/latest/imagesearch` basically shows you your previous search

<a href="https://mighty-mesa-11110.herokuapp.com/">Click here to view on heroku</a>

##Note

This repo does not contain some files which may require the app to work.

If the heroku doesn't reply (status 503), it's most likely because of the expired google keys.

It is possible to use third party npm rather than trying to do custom search
